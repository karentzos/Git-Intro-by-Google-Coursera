# Git-Intro-by-Google-Coursera

This is the first step on working with Git and Github.

A. In order to start working use command: git clone <https:// the link of your git-repo>
B. If you change sth directly from the web-repo use the command :  "git pull" directly from your local repo to update it accordingly with the master.
   However, be careful of how you use it.
   
C. Create localy a new directory: 
   mkdir checks //
   cd checks //
   git init   (Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/karentzos/Desktop/GitAll/Git-Intro-by-Google-Coursera/checks/.git/)
